# JustJump

## Term 3 Project 2026
Race through a series of 2D levels jumping and wall jumping with only one button. It has levels that start out as a grassy plain to teach you how to play, then goes to a really hard lava area near the final stages of the game. There is also going to be a final boss. It will have a timer and if it runs out you lose, so you have to collect time buffs around the map for more time. The movement would be like the King of Thieves mobile game.

### Key Elements:
* Powerups
* Hard Levels
* Final Boss
* Multiplayer?
