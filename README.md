# JustJump

## Term 3 Project 2026
It would also have physics, you would race through a series of levels jumping and wall jumping with only one button. It would have different levels and start out as a grassy area, then goes to a lava area near the final stages of the game. I would also add a boss where you have to dodge his lasers and hit these buttons to damage him. It would have a timer and you lose if you run out, so you have to collect these clocks around the map for more time. The movement would be kind of like the King of Thieves mobile game.
