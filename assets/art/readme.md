## How I did it:
* I used the tilemapping tool to drag and brush tiles onto the map
* I made a single background picture, and added it onto the screen. Then I moved it to the background by dragging it in the 3D view
* I solved the problem of adding a png to the tilemapper, but I just had to drag it in

## Future Edits:
* Making the guy move using inputs
* More sprites and more art
* Change solid background picture to tiling, for a better asthetic look
